    <h2>Philosophy</h2>
    <p>
    We believe that as children develop, their early experiences in life are embedded into the architecture of 
    their behaviours. This can make a profound consequences on how their lives unfold. At Pineapple Club Family Day
    Care, we provide a loving, caring and safe environment to promote positive behaviours to help them developing social skills that can make a huge different for their futures.

    The children are encouraged to treat each other with respect and dignity regardless of their culture, 
    language and home experience.
    </p>

    <p>
    We believe that every child is different in their own special way, through the ongoing observations, 
    our activities are tailored to every child’s specific needs to fit their current skills and to expand to areas 
    of potential. We believe that children learn through plays so the activities are designed to be enjoyable and  
    educational that assist them with the language, problem solving, motor skill all together with independence and 
    social and emotional development.

    We acknowledge that parents always want the best for the child and so do we, the parent’s idea and suggestion 
    are valued highly. Parents are encouraged to anticipate in the decision making, daily programs and long term 
    goals for the child.
